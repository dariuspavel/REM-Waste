# REMWaste

I begin by creating a React project with Typescript using Vite

First step, i'm implementing the backend in order to get the data from the API
After the data is fetched it will be displayed on the SelectSkipPage
(The API url is saved in a different file in order to avoid make it public and it will not be uploaded to Github)
